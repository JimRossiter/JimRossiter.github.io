## Progress in KC7 Cybersecurity Analysis by Microsoft
I am currently engaged in the KC7 Cybersecurity Analysis, a gamified simulation of the real-life role of a threat analyst, produced by Microsoft. This immersive experience has provided me with hands-on training in threat detection, malware analysis, and breach investigation. 

Key skills developed so far include proficiency in Kusto Query Language (KQL), investigative and problem-solving abilities, and the capability to assess and respond to cybersecurity threats effectively. This program is significantly enhancing my practical experience and expertise in cybersecurity analysis.
